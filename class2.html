            <p>Donald Trump seized the opportunity to mock President Joe Biden's slip-up during his 'Big Boy' press conference. Following Biden's earlier gaffe of mistakenly referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as 'President Putin', the POTUS sparked another round of internet mockery with yet another embarrassing moment. As he began to take questions, the president stumbled almost immediately. This time, Biden left the crowd baffled by referring to Vice President Kamala Harris as 'Trump'.</p>
